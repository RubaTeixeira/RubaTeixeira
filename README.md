# About Me
- 👋 Hi, I’m @RubaTeixeira
- 🗣️ How to say my name: Robber vall
- 👀 I’m interested in Chatbots, Data Analysis and Quality Assurance.
- 🌱 I'm in a process of continuous learning.

## My history
I've worked in customer service for a long time, mainly in technical support. As a result of this experience, at the last company I worked for, I was invited to take part in the smoke test routines for the bank account application. I did the regressive test manually, to check the functionality of all the application's functions, especially when there were new features.

From this experience I ended up becoming interested in the QA routine, which led me to start my studies and also to a promotion, so, in my most recent routine, I worked with the project team, focused on the quality of chatbot service; looking for flaws and opportunities for improvement, through manual tests, designs of new solutions and suggestions for automation to increase the bot's retention capacity.

These were enriching experiences that encouraged me to follow a new professional path and brought me here!
